## NOTE
- Check the header of pyc file, you can find that belong to python 3.13 version. So just download the python3.13 installer to execute that pyc file.
- This challenge has 3 part: part1 is cracking the hash, part2 is recover these equations to calc and the final part is reversing the algorithm

File `bruteforcing_hash.py` is find the password of part1. Part2 and part3 is on the file `solve.py`. Also I recovered this pyc to Python source. Hope you all enjoy my solution!
